Weighing in at just 60 lines of code (excluding comments), the BareBones MVC framework for PHP5 is perfect for:
  * small-to-medium websites; in other words, the vast majority, i.e. shared hosting sites without htaccess and/or mod_rewrite capabilities
  * as a foundation for PHP software such as CMS, weblog and/or wiki software
  * as a foundation for a "full stack" framework; e.g with (request) dispatching ,,1,,, object-relational mapping (ORM) ,,2,,, etcetera (see footnotes at bottom)

BareBones' sole goal is proper separation of concerns between the Model, View and Controller layers; this is achieved through just two abstractions, the controller itself and a "ModelTransferObject" (MTO), and is exemplified through the source for the following "template method":

{{{
    static function sendResponse(IBareBonesController $controller) {
      $controller->setMto($controller->applyInputToModel());
      $controller->mto->applyModelToView();
    }
}}}

Using BareBones can be succinctly summarized as requiring just 2 steps:
  # implementing applyInputToModel()
  # calling sendResponse()

Or, in more detail, from the source comments:
{{{
   * require('barebones.lib.php');                             // 1) require
   * 
   * class DemoController extends AbstractBareBonesController {// 2) extend
   *   function applyInputToModel() {                          // 3) implement
   *     $mto = new BareBonesMTO('barebones.tpl.php');         // 4) instantiate
   *     $mto->setModelValue('message', 'bare bones demo');    // 5) assign
   *     session_start(); $_SESSION['preserved'] = 1;          // 6) preserve (optional)
   *     return $mto;                                          // 7) return
   *   }
   * }
   * 
   * DemoController::sendResponse(new DemoController());       // 8) send
}}}

_Note that despite being static, because sendResponse() accepts a new object instance, thread safety is maintained through "stack confinement"_

"A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."
(Antoine de Saint-Exupery)

    # =====Because AbstractBareBonesController::sendResponse() is static, if htaccess and mod_rewrite functionality is exposed to your website, it is an easy matter to add dispatching, _without_ relying on reflection.=====
    # =====By not coupling itself to a specific ORM implementation, BareBones' avoids bloat that would be unnecessary should database access not be necessary, and might even encourage a more orthogonal design and/or best-of-breed approach when ORM is deemed necessary=====
